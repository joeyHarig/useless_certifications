# uselesscertifications

Uselesscertifications.com is a personal / school project. The site is written in vanilla javascript, html, and css. It is written as a playground to experiment with google analytics, SEO, and google ads. 

The target user: Individuals with too much free time and a love for surfing the web. 


----Things to be improved----

Currently the quiz information is stored in an object. I would like to store this information in an array so that the event listeners can be set up in a loop. Each quiz object within the array would include the quiz information, photo, and css styles. 

Eventually, quiz information will be moved to the server side in order to improve security and site loading efficiency.

The css is functional, but the code is not pretty. I will should go through the css file to make sure that nothing is redundant. 

Incorporate the ability for users to input their information and then load a custom certification pdf with their name and the date.

Write some more funny certifications :)
